You can use whatever title and Author name you want. Leave other options as it is.\n\n1 – # in the doc indicates the title. The more # you put, the smaller the text size gets. # (biggest) -&gt; ####(Smallest)\n2 – Area that wrapped with {r} and is called “Chunk,” where codes you want to run goes. # in the chunks indicates comment, which will not get executed.\n3 – When you click Run, you’ll see which part of doc you want to execute. If you click specific chunk and “Run Current Chunk,” only clicked chunk will be executed. This is one advantage of Quarto doc too.\nNow, save your quarto doc and Render. You’ll see that (Title).html file is created in your directory (1-&gt;2-&gt;3 marked in the picture). Congrats! You just created your first report using R.

For example, if you create one with mix of int and float, all values will be float. Why? because all int can be float by adding “.0” but float cannot be int without losing data. Let’s see an example.\n\nx &lt;- c(1,3,5,7,9.2)\nx\n\n[1] 1.0 3.0 5.0 7.0 9.2\n\n\nRecall c() meant to “connect.” This means you can connect multiple vectors into one as long as they match data type.\n\nz &lt;- c(x, y)\nz\n\n [1]  1.0  3.0  5.0  7.0  9.2  2.0  4.0  6.0  8.0 10.0\n\n\nQuestion: What will happen if we flip the order of element? As you can see below, resulting order of elements in the vector also changes.\n\nz &lt;- c(y, x)\nz\n\n [1]  2.0  4.0  6.0  8.0 10.0  1.0  3.0  5.0  7.0  9.2\n\n\nNow we learned how to create vectors with number. But what if we want to label something and need 1 to 100? Typing them manually will take some time. Instead, there’s a short cut to create continuous numbers with “:” operator. There there two points to remember when using :.\n\nIt has fixed increment of 1.\nIt follows the order from the left to the right. Check the example below.\n\n\n1:10\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n10:1\n\n [1] 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1\n\n0.2:3\n\n[1] 0.2 1.2 2.2\n\n\nWhat if you want to create vector with different increment? You can use seq() function. It has three main arguments - from, to, by. “from” is where the sequence starts, “to” is where it ends, and “by” is the increment.\n\nseq(1, 10)\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\nseq(1, 10, by=2)\n\n[1] 1 3 5 7 9\n\nseq(length=5, from=1, by=2)\n\n[1] 1 3 5 7 9\n\n\nIf you want to create vector with repeated values, you can use rep() function. It has two main arguments - “x” and “times”. “x” is the value you want to repeat, and “times” is how many times you want to repeat it.\n\nrep(5, times=4)\n\n[1] 5 5 5 5\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Calculations with Vectors\n\nElement wise operation Just like how we perform calculations with single numbers, we can do the same with vectors. One strong advantage of R is that it’s one of rare programming languages that can perform “vectorized” calculations. This means you can perform calculations using same position of different vectors without complex logics. Let’s perform example calculation using vectors we created.\n\n\nx &lt;- seq(0, 40, by = 10)\ny &lt;- c(1:5)\n\nx + y\n\n[1]  1 12 23 34 45\n\nx * y\n\n[1]   0  20  60 120 200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecycling rule What if the length of vectors are different? In this case, R will recycle the shorter vector until it matches the length of longer vector. Check the example below.\n\n\nz &lt;- c(rep(x, times=2), 50)\nz + y\n\nWarning in z + y: 두 객체의 길이가 서로 배수관계에 있지 않습니다\n\n\n [1]  1 12 23 34 45  1 12 23 34 45 51\n\n\nAs you can see, addition is performed even though length of two vectors didn’t match. The warning sign is indicating that length’s are not multiple of each other, so it shows what we mean by “recycle until it matches the length.” If it’s difficult to grasp, there’s a visualization below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Functions helpful for numeric vectors\nThere are many functions that can be used with numeric vectors. Here are some of the most commonly used ones. While you might not end up not using them all, try them out and see which ones are useful for you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperation\nDiscription\n\n\n\n\nlength(x)\nReturn length of the vector\n\n\nsum(x)\nReturn sum of all elements in the vector\n\n\nmean(x)\nReturn average of all elements\n\n\nmedian(x)\nReturn median of all elements\n\n\nvar(x)\nReturn variance of all elements\n\n\nsd(x)\nReturn standard deviation of all elements\n\n\nmax(x)\nmin(x)\nrange(x)\nReturn highest number in the vector\nReturn lowest number in the vector\nReturn the range (highest and lowest) number\n\n\nrank(x)\nReturn the “ranking” of each element from smallest to biggest\n\n\nsort(x)\nReorganize vector from smallest to biggest elements\n\n\norder(x)\nReturn index of smallest to biggest element’s location\n\n\nwhich.max(x)\nwhich.min(x)\nReturn the highest number’s index\nReturn the lowest number’s index\n\n\nwhich(x)\nReturn index of whatever element that satisfies the condition\n\n\n\nrank/sort/order can be confusing, so here’s the example.\n\nx &lt;- c(11,14,12,13,15)\nx\n\n[1] 11 14 12 13 15\n\n\n\n# Rank returns the ranking of each element in entire vector\nrank(x)\n\n[1] 1 4 2 3 5\n\n\n\n# Order returns Where the element is located in the original vector if we sorted it\norder(x)\n\n[1] 1 3 4 2 5\n\n\n\n# Sort returns the vector sorted from smallest to biggest\nsort(x)\n\n[1] 11 12 13 14 15",

They allow you to control the flow of your program based on conditions. However, we’ll discuss about it briefly here since other contents are heavy as well. If you want to learn more about it, let me know anytime.\nif statement returns true when the condition is met. It’s like a gateway before executing next code. “Do if condition is met? Then move to next line of code. If not, then skip to else statement (or end the if statement).”\nelse statement is executed when the if condition is not met. It’s like the alternative path when the if condition fails.\nBoth if and else statements are wrapped around {}.\nHere’s the example:\n\nIftest &lt;- c(1,3,5,7,9)\n\nif (any(Iftest &gt; 5)) \n  {\n  print(\"At least one element is greater than 5\")\n} else \n  {\n  print(\"No elements are greater than 5\")\n}\n\n[1] \"At least one element is greater than 5\"\n\n\nFor readability, R allows you to combine ifelse into a single line. It looks like this: ifelse(Condition, Value if TRUE, Value if FALSE)\n\nifelse(any(Iftest &gt; 5), \"At least one element is greater than 5\", \"No elements are greater than 5\")\n\n[1] \"At least one element is greater than 5\"",

So there’s other ways to handle manipulation of text vectors.\n\n3.3.1 Functions helpful for text vectors\nFirst, we should check if all elements are text, as vector require everything to be same type. But in huge data set, it might be tough to manually check everything. So we have “.ascharacter()” function to convert everything into text.\n\nmixedvec &lt;- c(\"Apple\", 2, \"Banana\", 4.5, TRUE)\nmixedvec &lt;- as.character(mixedvec)\nmixedvec\n\n[1] \"Apple\"  \"2\"      \"Banana\" \"4.5\"    \"TRUE\"  \n\n\nTry code by yourself. Did you notice that all inputs are as text when they were originally text, int, float, bool?\nNow, let’s look at how we can combine and split text vectors like addition/substraction. Both cases, they follow same element wise operation and recycle rule like numeric vectors.\nFor combining text vectors, we can use paste() function. If you want to add space between combined texts, use sep=” ” argument. One point is that you can paste how many vectors you want, but you can call sep =” ” one once per line. So if you want to have different seperators between multiple vectors, you’ll need to call paste() multiple times. So it’ll look like this:\n\nnames &lt;- c(\"Banana\", \"Apple\", \"Carrot\", \"Grape\", \"Whatelse\")\nprice &lt;- c(\"1.00\", \"2.50\", \"0.75\")\ncombined &lt;- paste(names, price, sep=\": $\") #Combine name and price with \": $\" in between\ncombined #Do you notice recycling rule here?\n\n[1] \"Banana: $1.00\"   \"Apple: $2.50\"    \"Carrot: $0.75\"   \"Grape: $1.00\"   \n[5] \"Whatelse: $2.50\"\n\n\nFor spliting text vectors, we can use strsplit() function. When you split, you use split=” ” argument to specify where to split.\n\nsplitnames &lt;- strsplit(combined, split=\": \")\nsplitnames #Name and price are seperated using \":\" as the split point\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"Banana\" \"$1.00\" \n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"Apple\" \"$2.50\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"Carrot\" \"$0.75\" \n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"Grape\" \"$1.00\"\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"Whatelse\" \"$2.50\"   \n\n\nThere are many other functions that’s helpful with handling vectors. However, due to it’s amount, we’ll mention only few that’s commonly used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpertiona\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnchar(x)\nReturn character counts of each elements in the vector x. *Literally all characters, including space, are counted!\n\n\nsubstr(x, start, stop)\nReturn character counts of each element in the vector x, starting from ’start’th character to the ’stop’th character.\n\n\ngrep(target, x, ignore.case=T, fixed=T)\nReturn the index of element in vector x that contains “target”. ignore.case asks if you want grep() to be case sensitive (T as yes). fixed asks if you want to use Regex (We don’t be discussing about this here.

We can use is.na() and na.omit() functions. is.na() checks if there is NA values, and na.omit() removes all NA values from the vector.\n\nscores &lt;- c(90, 85, NA, 70, 95, NA, 80)\nis.na(scores)  #It'll return TRUE if there's NA in the vector\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\n\nscores &lt;- na.omit(scores)  #It'll remove all NA\nscores\n\n[1] 90 85 70 95 80\nattr(,\"na.action\")\n[1] 3 6\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"omit\"\n\n\nLook at the output of na.omit(). Second/Fourth line - attr() shows what type of work is by the code. Ignore them First line - Vector after removing NA values Third line - Attribute showing which index values were removed due to NA Fifth line - What’s done by the code (removing NA values)\nHowever, using is.na() and na.omit() everytime can be time-consuming in big dataset. How can we “ignore” them without removing them? Many functions in R have “na.rm” argument. Setting na.rm=T will ignore NA values during calculation.\n\nscores &lt;- c(90, 85, NA, 70, 95, NA, 80)\nmean(scores, na.rm=T)  #Calculate mean while ignoring NA values\n\n[1] 84\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Vectors with NaN\nNaN is used to represent mathematically undefined values. For example, if you try to divide 0 by 0, the result is undefined even thought we know that data type is numbers. In this case, R will return NaN. Just like NA, we can use is.nan() function to check if there’s NaN values in the vector. To know if vector actually contains NaN, you must use is.nan() because is.na() will return TRUE for both NA and NaN.\n\n\n3.4.3 Index\nI mentioned “index” multiple times before, and you probably grasped somewhat sense of what it is. Index is a location of element in the vector. In R, index starts from 1 (not 0 like other programming languages). You can use index to call specific elements in the vector by indicating interested index in []. Here’s the example:\n\nx &lt;- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)\nx[3]  #Call the 3rd element in the vector x\n\n[1] 30\n\n\nBut one thing to be careful is that you cannot call two indicies at once. Try x[3,5] and see if it works.\nInstead, you can use c() to connect multiple indices.\n\nx &lt;- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)\nx[c(2,4)]  #Call 2nd and 4th elements in the vector x\n\n[1] 20 40",
