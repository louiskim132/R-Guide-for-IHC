Let’s explore how R Studio looks and what each section does.\nWhen you open R Studio, you’ll see 4 main sections.\n1 – Script Editor: This is where you write and save your code.\n2 – Console: It’s a communication window between you and the computer. You can check What/how computer is executing or give a one-time command. A script is something you can save and reuse. Console doesn’t have memory–All commands you make there will disappear when you close R Studio.\n3 – Environment: You’ll work with countless variables. This section shows what variables you’ve saved as you run your code.\n4 – Directories: Sometimes you need to load data or files for your code. This section shows which files are in your working folder.",
