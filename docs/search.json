There are two ways to create a script.\n\nScript and Quarto Document are most common files used to save the codes. Difference between to are what the default text is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nScript (Talking to computer)\nPlain texts are considered as code, and you need to use special characters to insert “comments.” It’s for purely performing code it’s written.\n\n\nQuarto Document (Talking to human)\nPlain texts are considered as text, and you need to insert “Chunks” to tell R Studio ‘These are codes I want to run.’ You can export Quarto Doc as beautiful report, which Script can’t.\n\n\n\nThis year, we’ll use Quarto Doc as we need to create reports and share codes to others.\nCreate Quarto Doc. You can use whatever title and Author name you want. Leave other options as it is.\n\n1 – # in the doc indicates the title. The more # you put, the smaller the text size gets. # (biggest) -&gt; ####(Smallest)\n2 – Area that wrapped with {r} and is called “Chunk,” where codes you want to run goes. # in the chunks indicates comment, which will not get executed.\n3 – When you click Run, you’ll see which part of doc you want to execute. If you click specific chunk and “Run Current Chunk,” only clicked chunk will be executed. This is one advantage of Quarto doc too.\nNow, save your quarto doc and Render. You’ll see that (Title).html file is created in your directory (1-&gt;2-&gt;3 marked in the picture). Congrats! You just created your first report using R. When you open the file, you’ll see how quarto doc became visually pretty and clear.",

It can’t remember anything you say or R executes, making you to retype everything to do same job. This gets annoying fast, especially if your code gets long. How can we make this easy? We’ll figure it out in next the next section.",

Variables are names that store data values.\nYou can declare a variable by using the assignment operator ‘&lt;-’ or ‘=’.\n\nTest1 &lt;- 3\nTest2 = 4\n\nOnce you declare the variable, you’ll see them in the Environment tab. Also, you’ll be able to call them by simply typing their names.\n\nTest1\n\n[1] 3\n\nTest2\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nIf it’s not working, it’s probably due to variable names. There’re specific rules in naming - First character must be dot(.) or letter. It cannot be number or special character. Second character and later can be anything - You cannot use other function’s name as variable name (sum, mean, etc. We’ll cover functions as we go on) - Variable names are case-sensitive. “test” and “Test” are different variables. - Avoid using spaces in variable names. Use dot(.) or underscore(_) instead. E.g.) my.variable, my_variable",
