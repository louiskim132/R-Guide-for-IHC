You’ll see it’s printing 2, the result of what you asked R to calculate.\n\nHowever, Console is one-time-communicator. It can’t remember anything you say or R executes, making you to retype everything to do same job. This gets annoying fast, especially if your code gets long. How can we make this easy?
