# Structure of R Studio

R is a programming language. R Studio is a UI that helps you write, run, and organize your R code. Let’s explore how R Studio looks and what each section does.

## Creating a Project

When we write codes and save data, it's important to keep everything organized so that R can remember where things were saved. To tell R Studio where to save and find your files, we use project. It's like a home for your codes and data.

Let’s make a new project.

1.  Click “File -\> New Project -\> New Directory -\> New Project”
2.  Choose location of folder you want to be, a good name, and click “Create Project”

Congrats! You just made your first project in R. Now let's start exploring what features are there in R Studio.

## UI of R Studio

On the main page of R Studio, you'll see 4 main sections.

1 – Script Editor: This is where you write and save your code.

2 – Console: It's a communication window between you and the computer. You can give him commands to execute, and console will show you what it's doing.

3 – Environment: You'll work with countless variables. This section shows what variables you've saved as you run your code.

4 – Directories: Sometimes you need to load data or files for your code. This section shows which files are in your working folder. Default is folder where your project is.

First, let's try typing anything into Console. Input 1 + 1 and press enter. You'll see it's printing 2, the result of what you asked R to calculate.

However, Console is one-time-communicator. It can't remember anything you say or R executes, making you to retype everything to do same job. This gets annoying fast, especially if your code gets long. How can we make this easy? We'll figure it out in next the next section.
